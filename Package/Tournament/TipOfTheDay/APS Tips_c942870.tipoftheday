      "The Grav-Ram Part is a standard ban in tournaments, as it has the potential to make fights boring to watch.",
      "The Disruptor-Smoke shell targets two active Defenses at once: Shields and LAMS. But it needs at least a caliber of 200mm to function.",
      "A timed FLAK-FRAG shell can be used against missiles and aircrafts. Making it a good dual-purpose shell.",
      "8m long HP-HE-FRAG shells with a caliber of 500mm can be devastating. A timed fuse can even make misses dangerous.",
      "A timed Sabot-FRAG shell with pendepth can make quick work with internals. Only problem is that FRAG is only at 25% of its power.",
      "A HESH-Frag shell creates interior spalling against internals and exterior spalling against the outer armour. You can also mix in some HEAT.",
      "For purely direct fed guns, the ammo customizer can have at most 30 blocks with shell components, allowing for a 30m long shell at maximum caliber.",
      "FLAK a high calibers can make short work of any missile swarm. Mostly because of its absurdly high explosion radius."
