Tournamententries on Team 2 had a wrongly colored Divider in their Textboxes.

Experimental Additions:
Under Advanced Options there is now the possibility to change the Pools of FtD. Countering Shell despawn by allowing more shells to exist.

Known Issues:
Changing location takes a few seconds to load, launching a battle too quickly can result in terrain loading after battle has begun or the battle jumping back to the default location. Allow a few seconds for the map to load before starting a battle.
Eyecandy-Settings only work for Team 2, despite the same code for Team 1. No Idea why...
