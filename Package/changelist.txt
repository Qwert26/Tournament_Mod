This version of the tournament mod is based on the wootness mod that stopped working after 2.2.x
It has been fixed and updated by Anickle and Qwert26.

Changes to the mod for versions 2.3.1.15 :

[v2.3.1.15]
Major Additions:
Added GUI-Settings for Out-Of-Bounds Reserve-Time and tolerated Fleeing-Speed.

Added GUI-Setting for literal infinte Resources for a Team or both Teams.
Added Advanced Battle Options:
	Readded Materialconversion-Setting, aka Lifesteal.
	Added GUI-Setting for Cleanup.
	Readded GUI-Setting for Health-Calculation and expanded it.
	Readded GUI-Setting for minimum Amount of Health Percentage
Added Eyecandy:
	Added GUI-Settings to change fleet colors of both teams with a variety of predefined packages.
Spawn-Settings:
	Added a Slider to rotate the entire battle field between -90° and 90°. Might consider a "Swap Teams"-Button.

Minor Additions:
Added "Tips of the Day".

Known Issues:
Changing location takes a few seconds to load, launching a battle too quickly can result in terrain loading after battle has begun or the battle jumping back to the default location. Allow a few seconds for the map to load before starting a battle.
Eyecandy-Settings only work for Team 2, despite the same code for Team 1. No Idea why...
